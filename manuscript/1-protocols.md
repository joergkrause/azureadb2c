# Identity Protocols

The theory behind modern security solutions is often underestimated. It's sometimes boring, too. However, skipping this might lead to issues later. It's likely you choose the wrong path or find a suboptimal solution by just not knowing what the standard procedure is under certain circumstances.

This chapter gives a brief overview of the fundamental protocols OAuth2 and Open ID Connect (OIDC). It's not the intention of the author to repeat all the standard proposals publicly available. However, for your convenience I have put in some text and illustrations to just added links to online resources where there is *more to read* just in case you really like it.

I know that writing this seems a peccadillo in a developer book. Not so much code to see here. Part of these protocols are the fundamental terms and definitions of the identity realm. Some dialogs in the Azure portal and more often names of interfaces, classes, and class members directly reflect that fact. If a class is called `IdentityClaim` it must be clear what this means. What exactly is an *Identity*, and what is a *Claim*? Usually, you'll not find any further explanation and the help text is often not that enlightening. Reading this chapter will enlighten you, hopefully.
